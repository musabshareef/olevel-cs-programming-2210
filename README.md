## Getting Started

You have two options to work with this repository: using GitHub Codespaces (recommended for beginners) or cloning the repository to your local machine.

### Option 1: GitHub Codespaces

GitHub Codespaces provides a complete, configurable dev environment in the cloud. Here's how to get started:

1. **Fork the repository**:
   - Click the "Fork" button at the top right of this repository page.
   - This creates your own copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

2. **Open in Codespaces**: 
   - In your forked repository, click the green "Code" button.
   - Select the "Codespaces" tab.
   - Click "Create codespace on main" to launch a new codespace.

3. **Wait for the environment to build**: 
   - This may take a few minutes the first time.

4. **Start learning**:
   - Once the codespace is ready, you'll see a VS Code-like interface in your browser.
   - Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory in the file explorer.
   - Click on a notebook to open and start learning!

5. **Run code**:
   - To run a code cell in a notebook, click the play button to the left of the cell or use the keyboard shortcut Shift+Enter.

6. **Complete exercises**:
   - Navigate to the `exercises/` directory to find practice exercises.
   - Complete the exercises in the provided code cells.

7. **Save your work**:
   - Your work is automatically saved in the codespace.
   - To keep your changes long-term, commit and push your changes to your forked repository.

Remember, Codespaces usage is subject to GitHub's free tier limits. Make sure to stop your codespace when you're done working to conserve your usage time.

### Option 2: Local Setup

If you prefer to work on your local machine:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/musabshareef/olevel-cs-programming-2210.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and open the Jupyter notebooks to start learning.
